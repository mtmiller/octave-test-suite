Octave Test Suite
=================

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This is a set of tests written for GNU Octave.

Octave does have its own built-in unit test suite. This set of tests is
meant to complement the built-in test suite or to test Octave in other
ways.

For now, this includes tests of Octave's command line options, its exit
status, and other command shell interface behavior.

Requirements
------------

* GNU Octave, preferably version 4.4.1 or the development branch
* shunit2
